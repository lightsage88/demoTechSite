      <p>I love coding that helps me make peoples day, life, work, and world just a little bit more fun, useful, and loving.</p>
      <p>I started out as an opera singer, then I was a taxi driver. After a bit of that, I went into tax preparation and hated it.</p>
      <p>The good thing about tax prep, is I know how to grease the wheels of a return to get some excellent deductions and to maximize your refund, legally of course. I aint no Trump.</p>
      <p>Anyways, I fell into coding and have had an interesting relationship with it. It has done me good. It has done me dirty, but I never quit. I never give up. And each thing I make is cooler than the last.</p>
      <p>I guess that's a good sign! I'm not toxic to work with, but I'll admit I'm not the greatest. I still sing opera too, and that's my main thing.</p>
      <p>We could probably still help eachother out, so hit me up and let's get down to business!</p>
      </div>
